This release aims to be better rendered by a screen reader.
mcvox 0.1 manages three main areas: the menubar, the main panel, and
the message line.

Most elements such as the menu items, input elements, labels are
displayed one line at a time; the cursor is upon this line. 

Any input element is announced using a prefix: 'Button', 'Input',
'Checkbox', 'Radio'.
